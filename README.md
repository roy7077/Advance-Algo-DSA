# Advanced Algorithm Practice for Competitive Programming

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share concepts and problems related to advanced algorithmic techniques and data structures. This repository is designed for those aiming to improve their problem-solving skills in the 1800 ~ 2200 difficulty range, particularly useful for competitive programming and technical interviews.

## Getting Started

If your goal is to seek new opportunities or excel in competitive programming, it's a good time to start practicing more advanced topics. By now, you should be comfortable with most medium-level problems and familiar with fundamental algorithms and data structures.

## Advanced Topics to Explore

To achieve a breakthrough in your problem-solving skills, consider diving into the following advanced topics. These are often not required for routine development but can give you a significant edge in competitions and interviews:

1. **Difference Array**
2. **BIT Tree (Fenwick Tree)**
3. **Basic Math Algorithms**
   - Sieve of Eratosthenes
   - Modular Inverse
4. **Trie**
5. **Advanced String Algorithms**
   - KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
   - Rolling Hash
6. **Monotonic Stack**
7. **Sliding Window**
8. **Bit Manipulation**
9. **Union Set (Disjoint Set)**
10. **Bitmask DP (Dynamic Programming)**
11. **Graph Algorithms**
    - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
    - Minimum Spanning Tree

## Practice Strategy

To excel in solving higher difficulty problems:

- **Practice Regularly:** Consistent practice is key to becoming proficient.
- **Solve Medium Problems Comfortably:** Ensure you can solve most medium problems without assistance.
- **Tackle Hard Problems:** Aim to solve at least half of the hard problems independently.
- **Improve Typing Speed:** Fast and accurate typing can make a difference during timed contests.

## Repository Structure

- **Concepts:** Detailed explanations and implementations of each advanced topic.
- **Problems:** A collection of practice problems categorized by difficulty and topic.
- **Solutions:** Step-by-step solutions to selected problems.
